## A Rust application to search series and movies

An application to search for movies and series. It will print the result in the terminal. You will need an API key from ![TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started)

I made this application in Rust, mainly to learn a new future proof language. It is challenging, but i like it!
